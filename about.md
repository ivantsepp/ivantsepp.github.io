## Who am I?
I am a web develop at [Paperless Post] in New York City.
We help you create online and paper stationery that reflects your individual aesthetic.
And we are [hiring]!  

Currently, my main focus is on [Ruby] and [Ruby on Rails] but I am also interested in Javascript.
Subscribe to my [RSS Feed] to follow my adventures in programming!

## What is this site for?
I don't really blog but I wanted my personal website be more than a showcase of projects/work.
So I decided to write posts about the latest things I've been messing around with.
Writing articles or posts about technology is a good exercise in documenting my thoughts and exploring the
content more depth. As a side effect, I hope my writing will help others in learning the material!  

Thanks for visiting my website and if you'd like, please leave some [feedback]!

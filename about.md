## Who am I?
I am a web developer at [Paperless Post] in New York City. We help you create online and paper stationery that reflects your individual aesthetic. And we are [hiring]!

Currently, my main focus is on [Ruby] and [Rails] but I am also interested in Javascript. Subscribe to my [RSS Feed] to follow my adventures in programming.

## What is this site for?
I'm not a blogger so this isn't my personal blog. Instead, I will be writing posts about the latest things I've been hacking around with. This will be a good exercise in documenting my thoughts and exploring the content more depth. As a side effect, I hope my writing will help others learn a new thing or two.

Thanks for visiting my website and if you'd like, please leave some [feedback] or buy me something from my [wishlist].
